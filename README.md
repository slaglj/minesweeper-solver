# minesweeper_solver

Minesweeper Solver is simply a personal project I took up to round out my coding skills. In it I implement minesweeper in Python (Python 3 to be exact) with the Pygame library. In it I implemented the game as well as algorithms to solve it. An actual release of the code is pending.

Check out theory/theory.pdf to read about the development of the solving algorithms.
