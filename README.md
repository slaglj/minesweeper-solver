# minesweeper_solver

Minesweeper Solver is simply a personal project I took up to round out my coding skills. In it I implement minesweeper in Python 3 with the Pygame library. In it I implemented the game as well as algorithms to solve it. 

Check out theory/theory.pdf to read about the development of the solving algorithms. The main files of interest beyond that are solve.py, game.py and display.py
